# 🚦 AI-Based Adaptive Traffic Controller

This project simulates and controls a smart traffic light system using AI. It adapts to real-time traffic congestion and gives priority to emergency vehicles.

## 🔧 Modes
- **Simulation Mode**: Uses random or CSV-based inputs to visualize traffic decisions.
- **Prototype Mode**: Connects to real hardware (IR sensors, LEDs) for real-time control.

## 📁 Folder Overview
- `data/`: Sample traffic inputs
- `images/`: Visual outputs and screenshots
- `simulation/`: Notebook-based simulation
- `prototype/`: Hardware-ready Python modules
