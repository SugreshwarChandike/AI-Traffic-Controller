# 🚦 AI-Based Adaptive Traffic Controller

This project simulates and controls a smart traffic light system using AI. It adapts to real-time traffic congestion and gives priority to emergency vehicles.

## 🔧 Modes
- **Simulation Mode**: Uses random or CSV-based inputs to visualize traffic decisions.
- **Prototype Mode**: Connects to real hardware (IR sensors, LEDs) for real-time control.

## 📁 Folder Overview
**- Simulation Mode:** Implements a simplified model that replicates the workflow with randomized inputs to visualize and test system functionality in an online environment.
   - `data/`: Sample traffic inputs
   - `images/`: Visual outputs and screenshots
   - `simulation/`: Notebook-based simulation.

**- Prototype Mode:** Hardware-ready Python modules
