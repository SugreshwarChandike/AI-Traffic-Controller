“Simulated AI-based traffic light system with congestion learning and emergency priority”
# 🚦 AI-Based Adaptive Traffic Controller

This project simulates a smart traffic light system using AI. It adapts to real-time traffic congestion and gives priority to emergency vehicles — all without physical hardware.

## 🔧 Features
- Simulated traffic input using random data
- AI decision-making for green light control
- Emergency vehicle detection
- Visual simulation using Python

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- GitHub

## 📁 Files
- `traffic_simulation.ipynb`: Main notebook
- `data/sample_traffic.csv`: Simulated traffic data
- `models/traffic_model.pkl`: Trained model (optional)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `traffic_simulation.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Run each cell to simulate traffic and AI decisions
3. View visual output of traffic light control
